        <p>  Hello, I am **Maria**, welcome to my portfolio!</p> 
       
<p>I am a <a href="https://master-cde.eu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Erasmus Mundus Joint Master (EMJM) "Copernicus Master in Digital Earth" (CDE)</a> Student in my first year at Paris Lodron University of Salzburg. Here, I am developing a strong understanding of earth observation and geoinformatics. Next year, I will go to Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, to specialize in Geovisualization and Geocommunication. </p>
    <p>This course is proudly co-funded by the European Union, and I am honoured to be the holder of a full scholarship, reflecting my previous academic achievements and experiences. Please click on the logos below to learn more about the CDE programme and its host universities.</p>

       <p> Currently, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge of Remote Sensing Techniques and the utilisation of Big Data alongside the continual expansion of my Cartographic skills. Overall, my study interests focus on changing environments with a specific interest in geomorphology and the cryosphere. </p>

         <strong>Travel - Career Break | September 2021 - September 2022 </strong>
         <br>Following completion of my Undergraduate degree, I worked as a Swimming Teacher and backpacked across northern Europe. Fond memories from this time include hiking in remote areas of Norway and staying in off-grid Nowrweigian Treking Association cabins.

        <strong>Travel - Career Break | September 2018 - September 2019 </strong>
        <br>Following completion of school, I lived in Australia for one year. I travelled along the whole East Coast from Adelaide to Cairns. This time solidified my love for the physical environment, whilst developing personal drive and self-motivation to make the most of my time here.

<h2>Other important bits!</h2>

<p> I am competent in using Microsoft Suite, ESRI Suite and QGIS, and have corporate experience across all these products. I also have experience using Python and JavaScript. My long-term favourite geospatial processing tool is Google Earth Engine (GEE) simply because of how versatile yet powerful it is! </p> 
<p> English is my mother tongue, but I am also currently learning Czech and German. </p>     
<p> I am proudly a Practitioner with the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment <a href="https://www.iema.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(IEMA)</a> and a Registered Environmentalist (REnvP) with the Society for the Environment <a href="https://socenv.org.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(SocEnv)</a>.  </p> 
<p> In my free time I seek out adventures, whether that be hiking, skiing or on my road bike. I am currently training for my second marathon, in May 2025, and hope to complete an Ironman in 2026!  </p>
