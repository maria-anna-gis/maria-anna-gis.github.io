        <p>  Hello! Welcome to my portfolio!      <p> 
       
    I am a Copernicus Master in Digital Earth Student in my first year at Paris Lodron University of Salzburg. Here, I am developing a strong understanding of earth observation and geoinformatics. Next year, I will go to Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, to specialize in Geovisualization and Geocommunication. </p>
    
    This course is proudly co-funded by the European Union, and I am honoured to be the holder of a full scholarship, as a reflection of my previous academic achievement and experiences.</p>
    
       Currently, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge of Remote Sensing Techniques and the utilisation of Big Data alongside continual expansion of my Cartographic skills. 
       Overall, my research interests focus on changing environments with a specific interest in geomorphology and the cryosphere.
