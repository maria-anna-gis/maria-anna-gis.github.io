       <p> Currently, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge of Remote Sensing Techniques and the utilisation of Big Data alongside the continual expansion of my Cartographic skills. My study interests focus on image analysis of changing environments with a specific interest in geomorphology, climate change, and humanitarian applications. </p>

<h2>Other important bits!</h2>

<p>I have extensive corporate experience using Microsoft Suite, ESRI Suite and QGIS. I also have experience using Python and JavaScript. My favourite geospatial processing tool is Google Earth Engine (GEE) simply because of how versatile yet powerful it is! </p> 
<p> English is my mother tongue, but I am also currently learning Czech and German. </p>     
<p> I am proudly a Practitioner with the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment <a href="https://www.iema.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(IEMA)</a> and a Registered Environmentalist (REnvP) with the Society for the Environment <a href="https://socenv.org.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(SocEnv)</a>.  </p> 
<p> In my free time, I seek out adventures, whether that be hiking, skiing or on my road bike. I am currently training for my second marathon in May 2025, and plan to complete an Ironman in 2026!  </p>
