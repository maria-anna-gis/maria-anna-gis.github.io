       <p> Currently, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge of Remote Sensing Techniques and the utilisation of Big Data alongside the continual expansion of my Cartographic skills. Overall, my study interests focus on changing environments with a specific interest in geomorphology and the cryosphere. </p>
