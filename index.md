Hiya, my name is **Maria**, welcome to my e-portfolio! <p>I am a <a href="https://master-cde.eu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Erasmus Mundus Joint Master (EMJM) "Copernicus Master in Digital Earth" (CDE)</a> student in my first year at Paris Lodron University in Salzburg. Currently, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge of Remote Sensing Techniques and utilising Big Data alongside the continual expansion of my Cartographic skills. My  interests focus on image analysis of changing environments, with a specific interest in  climate change, geomorphology, and humanitarian applications. </p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
* <strong>Environmental Consultant, Savills, UK | September 2022 - September 2024 </strong>
<br>I authored planning reports for residential and commercial developments, as well as for larger Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) relating to Air Quality, Acoustics and Health. I integrated GIS throughout projects and developed a holistic understanding of the planning system in the UK whilst also gaining project management experience in a corporate environment.
* <strong>Career Breaks and travels</strong>
<br> Between 2018 and 2021, I spent time living on the East Coast of Australia, in Northern Italy (Turin and Bardonecchia), and also spent an extended period backpacking in Norway. Through all of this, I have developed a strong passion and appreciation for the beauty of Earth and I am driven to do my part in protecting it for generations to come.

<br>Current relevant modules include ‘Big Earth Data Concepts’, ‘Advanced Remote Sensing’, ‘Object-Based Image Analysis’, and ‘Advanced Cartography’.
* <strong>Cardiff University, Wales | July 2023: B.Sc., First Class Hons - Environmental Geography</strong>
<br>Final year modules included “Environmental Management, Science and Policy”, “Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis”, and “Environmental Geography Field course”.
<br>Final year thesis (Grade 71). “The greening signal and vegetation change occurring over the Arctic from 2000-2020, interpreted from MODIS NDVI and NOAA Aeolian Data Using Google Earth Engine”. 


<h2>Some other notes!</h2>
<p>I have corporate experience using Microsoft Suite, ESRI Suite and QGIS. I also have experience using Python and JavaScript. My current favourite geospatial processing tool is Google Earth Engine (GEE) simply because of how versatile yet powerful it is! </p>  
<p> I am proudly a Practitioner with the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment <a href="https://www.iema.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(IEMA)</a> and a Registered Environmentalist (REnvP) with the Society for the Environment <a href="https://socenv.org.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(SocEnv)</a>.</p> 
<p>English is my mother tongue and I am also currently learning Czech (A2) and German (A1). And, in my free time, I seek out adventures, whether that be hiking, skiing or on my road bike. I am currently training for my second marathon in May 2025, and plan to complete an Ironman in 2026!</p>
