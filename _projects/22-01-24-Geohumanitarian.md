As an elective module at Paris Lodron, 'Geohumanitarian Action' covered a wide range of topics such as conflict databases and prediction, compliance mapping, and spatial social media analysis. The experience was enriched by guest presentations from organizations like Spatial Services, UNSPIDER, and WFP.
My topic was Anticipatory Actionâ€” a proactive approach to mitigate potential disaster impacts before they fully unfold. I found it a particularly eye-opening topic, and you too can learn more about it in the ArcGIS Storymap below.
