In the 2022/23 glacial budget, Pasterze Glacier, the largest glacier in Austria, experienced an unprecedented retreat of 203.5 meters, marking the greatest loss since measurements began. This retreat equates to a loss of approximately 14.03 million cubic meters of ice at the glacier tongue [source](https://pro.earth/en/2024/04/07/vom-gletschersterben-der-alpenverein-misst-den-groessten-laengenschwund-bei-der-pasterze-seit-messbeginn/).
To explore this glacial retreat in more depth, I created a Google Earth Engine (GEE) application with interactive features to explore the glacial loss year-on-year. This includes a split screen with various year sliders to allow for greater customisation.
Copernicus Sentinel 2 data was utilised to create a normalised difference snow index (NDSI), and August was chosen as the month for visualisation to allow for clear comparison year-on-year; this is when cloud interference and general snow cover are less likely to interfere. Cloud cover has been set to 5% to minimise noise.
