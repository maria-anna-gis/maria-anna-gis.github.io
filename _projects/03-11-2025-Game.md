During my first semester within the Copernicus Digital Earth Master programme in collaboration with Emese Gojdar and Dastan Nurbekuly, we created a game!

The key objective we had was to make learning about the Copernicus services fun. This was done through the creation of 5 minigames related to Copernicus. A cat character, whom I narrated, guides the
player through the game, and explanations of the content and recommendations for further readings are provided throughout.

The target audience of our game is high school students or older (just anyone who is interested really!), so if you would like to experience our game, please see below! (Game best experienced full screen directly through Unity).
