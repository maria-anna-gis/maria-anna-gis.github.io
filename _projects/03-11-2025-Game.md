During my first semester within the Copernicus Digital Earth Master programme in collaboration with Emese Gojdar and Dastan Nurbekuly, we created a game!


The key objective we had was to make learning about the Copernicus services fun. This was done through the creation of 5 minigames related to Copernicus. A cat character, whom I narrated, guides the
player through the game, and explanations of the content and recommendations for further readings are provided throughout.

Below is a brief slide show, with an overview of our development process so far.
