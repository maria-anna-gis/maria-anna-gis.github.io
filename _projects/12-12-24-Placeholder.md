This section will soon be full of content, including things I learnt during my Undergraduate Degree in Environmental Geography from Cardiff University and time working as a Consultant, as well as things I am learning now as part of the <a href="https://master-cde.eu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Erasmus Mundus Joint Master (EMJM) â€œCopernicus Master in Digital Earth</a> Co-funded by the European Union.
Stay tuned!
