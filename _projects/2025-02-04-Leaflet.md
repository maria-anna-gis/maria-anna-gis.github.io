As someone who is passionate about all things outdoorsy and always wanting to explore something new, when I discovered the Ã–sterreichischer Alpenverein (Austrian Alpine Club) soon after arriving in Salzburg, I knew it was something I wanted to be a part of.

As a fun way to learn more about their huts whilst developing my coding skills during my Geovisualisation and Advanced Cartography course, I created a map using Leaflet of Alpenverein Huts solely within the state of Salzburg. This map is suitable for English speakers as a simple, high-level tool for planning trips.  

Below is a live demo, but for a better full-screen experience please click [**here**](https://maria-anna-gis.github.io/salz-huts/).
