### A time for reflection
At the time of writing this post, I have been in Salzburg for almost 5 months and that time has truly FLOWN by. It has been busy adjusting to life in another country as well as being a student again, but I have been thoroughly enjoying this new way of life.

### So what have I been up to?
Time has been largely spent studying, of course, but also skiing, hiking, running and cycling in this beautiful place I get to call home for the year. In terms of soft skills, the academic experiences I have gained have greatly strengthened my project management and presenting skills, and these are both things which I am very proud of.

### A quick debrief on modules taken
During the past semester I took 9 modules which covered a broad range of topics. I will list here my key takeaways/learning points from each.
* Spatial thinking and modelling: We discussed a lot about thinking spatially, why this is so important, and also tested our spatial thinking skills using [**rif**](https://rif4you.eu/index.php?spr=en).
* Career development: This really got me thinking about what will come after my 2 years in the CDE programme. It also gave me the nudge to create this website, which I am having so much fun developing as a relatively new coder!
* Advanced Remote Sensing: This covered image pre-processing, acquisition types, and knowledge representation. I developed a really strong understanding of how applications differ between different satellites, as well as practicing image segmentations and using synthetic aperture radar data to assess ground deformation.
* Digital Earth: Big Earth Data Concepts: I learnt a lot here about different data cubes and why they are so important, Copernicus services, Google Earth Engine (see [**here**](https://maria-anna-gis.github.io/projects/GEE) ), and how analysis ready data (ARD) can be a useful thing but should also be treated with caution.
* Geohumanitarian Action: I expanded my knowledge of various Geohumanitarian applications, you can read more about that [**here**](https://maria-anna-gis.github.io/projects/aa_for_geohum)
* Geovisualisation and Advanced Cartography: I explored various tools within the ESRI suite, developed my understanding of cartographic principles, and learnt about web mapping. You can see the Leaflet map I made within this module [**here**](https://maria-anna-gis.github.io/projects/Leaflet).
* Design of Geospatial Data Models: This covered business process modelling, XML, GML and other file formats. It got me thinking about the theory of GIS applications and ways in  which we can operate in a more efficient manner.
* Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA): This covered all things image segmentation including knowledge representation and class modelling. I spent a lot of time using the software 'E-Cognition' to segment images myself and identify objects within.
* German for Geoinformatics: I had been casually learning German before coming to Salzburg, so to have a structured environment for practicing speaking was so beneficial to me. It was also insightful to have a local's insight to Austrian traditions such as Perchtenlauf!

### And now looking forward
In the next semester, I am hoping to dig deeper into developing my coding abilities, specifically Python and R, as well as further advancing my cartographic skills.
Alongside university modules, I have already picked out some online courses which will supplement my learning.
On a personal level, I plan to spend even more time outside to explore as much of Salzburg as possible before I move to Czechia in September.
